## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
Variables with insufficient values have been lowered to make the dataset more reliable. Outliers have also been eliminated to provide more accurate statistics.

## Summary of Findings

> After studying each component, we noticed that 
 Of all the relationships we analyzed, from univariate exploration to multivariate exploration, we noted that all the features are negatively correlated to BorrowerAPR, most of which were ProspoerScore. 
We also noted that most features are positvyl correlated to prospoerScore.

> Borrowers with different degrees of messaging were also evaluated. Borrowers with the lowest HR rating were found to have a higher percentage of the annual assessment, and borrowers with the highest AA rating received a lower percentage than APR. This distinguishes individual groups in terms of APR gained based on their grades and grades.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> In the presentation first we introduced the data content and some details about the data and then introduced borrowerAPR values Distribution
We made her own notes. 
We then introduced Bivariate Exploration by illustrating BorrowerAPR & ProsperScore 
And we've determined what's the most important analysis we've got. 
Finally Multivariate Exploration and we presented here BorrowerAPR & ProsperScore & CreditScoreRangeUpper
